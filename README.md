# Meteor-Landings
A webpage showing world map and mapping the recorded meteor landing in the world. 

The page is made by HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the visualization done by using D3.js and D3's queue. The page takes data from the NASA's website (as a JASON) file and maps it on the world map. The real challenge was to make a world by th use of a JASON file and then plotting the landings by using another JASON file. The queue allowed to read 2 JASON files at once and draw the map of the world and map the points on it simultaneously.
